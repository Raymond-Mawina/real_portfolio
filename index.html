          Problem Solver | Analytical Thinker | Mentor | Code Monkey | Future

        <p>
          Hi there. My name is Raymond Mawina and I am a software engineer based
          in Pretoria, South Africa. My area of expertise is frontend
          development, what that means is that I design and craft intuitive web
          experiences for users, designing and implementing designs is my bread
          and butter. The work I do help users to complete their tasks with
          efficiency and on a timely manner.
        </p>

        <p>
          Brainstorming ways we can bring a particular clients vision and
          concepts to life keeps me energized. While I love being innovative and
          creative, I also appreciate best practices when it comes to user
          experience, user design and programming. Delivering work that meets
          and exceeds the clients expectations is what I do. I love learning and
          understand that to effectively grow I have to encounter challenges and
          overcome them.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I am not working hard, you can best believe that I am playing
          hard. I am a massive manga and anime fan, so when not too busy, I
          enjoy the story of villains and heroes. I am also a fan of
          professional wrestling, so yeah go figure. I also read a lot, most
          self improvement books and books around software development and user
          design and experience.

          <h3>Make It Stick: Problem Solver</h3>
          <p>
            I want to be better at problem solving using data structures and
            algorithms, thus far it has been hard to get the habit down and
            practice consistently. I have a tool in mind I'd like to create and
            experiment with.

          <p>
            Ever wonder what you were working on 10 months ago and find yourself
            struggling to recall? This is my currently pickle. I've like to log
            my daily work and non-work tasks so that I can review and uncover
            how I spend my time and come up with ways to become more efficient.

          <h3>Learners Driver, Lets Pass The Test</h3>
          <p>
            I want to learn to drive but in order for that to start, I need a
            learner driver's license. The problem is that I've already failed
            the test twice, each time by 1 or 2 points. I'd like to pass my 3rd
            test, so I am going to create a tool to get me there.

          <h3>Cooking Recipes and Meal Preps for Nerds</h3>
          <p>
            I live alone and like home cooked meals. I can cook, but I suck at
            coming up with recipes so I end up coming the same recipes over and
            over again. I'd like to create an app that will help me introduce
            variety to my taste buds.
