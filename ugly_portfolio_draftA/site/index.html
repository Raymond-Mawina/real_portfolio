          Hi there. My name is Raymond Mawina and I am a software engineer based
          in Pretoria, South Africa. My area of expertise is frontend
          development, that means is I design and craft intuitive web
          experiences for users, designing and implementing is my bread and
          butter. The work I do helps users to complete their tasks with
          efficiency and on a time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Brainstorming ways we can bring a particular client's vision and
          concepts to life keeps me energized. While I love being innovative and
          creative, I also appreciate best practices when it comes to user
          experience, user design and programming. Delivering work that meets
          and exceeds the clients expectations is what I do. I love learning and
          understand that to effectively grow, I have to encounter challenges
          and overcome them.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I am not working hard, you can best believe that I am playing
          hard. I am a massive manga and anime fan,so I enjoy the story of
          villains and heroes. I am also a fan of professional wrestling, so
          yeah go figure. I also read a lot, mostly self improvement books and
          books around software development and design.
